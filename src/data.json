Before Dialogflow CX came out, there was only Dialogflow ES and it was extremely hard to manage the flow of the agent (chatbot) as it did not have a graph editor. This graph editor was intended to fill in the gap, but Dialogflow CX got released about a week after.",

Our job was to deliver news every month and before using this app, we had to manually keep track of which delivery points have been made and remember the route which only occurs once a month. I found it quite inefficient and it was such a pain to teach the next person in the handover process. This app just removed that handover process and also has detailed pictures to show exactly where to place the packages.",
